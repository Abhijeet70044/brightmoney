                impact your
                credit score. If you're approved and activate Bright Credit we may do a hard inquiry<br>
                which may affect you credit score.<br>
                3. Bright uses standard industry practices to determine our customer satisfaction score. It's a metric
                used in all kinds of businesses to measure customer service and product quality. Businesses calculate
                their score by taking the number of satisfied customers (those who rated them 4 or higher) and dividing
                it by the total number of responses.
